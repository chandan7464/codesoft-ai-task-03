A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system that predicts and suggests items to users based on various algorithms and data. These systems are designed to provide personalized recommendations to users, improving their experience by introducing them to relevant products



Types of Recommendation Systems
Content-Based Filtering:

Description: This approach recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in, based on item features.
Example: If a user has liked several science fiction books, the system recommends other science fiction books.


Collaborative Filtering:

Description: This technique makes recommendations based on the preferences of other users. It assumes that if users agreed in the past, they will agree in the future.
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items liked by similar users.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items similar to those the user has liked in the past.
Example: If two users have a high overlap in their liked movies, one user will receive recommendations based on the other user's likes.


Hybrid Systems:

Description: These systems combine multiple recommendation techniques to improve accuracy and effectiveness.
Example: A system might use both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest new movies to a user.
